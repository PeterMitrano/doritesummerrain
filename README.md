#No Spoilers on *abc* **get** TV streaming sites



This chrome extension removes episode titles, thumbnails, and the embedded chats from get sites that offer TV shows with the intention of creating a spoiler free browsing experience.
For long series, even so much as an episode name can reveal what happens way down the line and can skew your perception on how the events of a show are going to unfold... not anymore!
